# Tender Parser Servise
Pet project #1. 

The service independently parses tender platforms (24/7) and fills the MySQL database.
The user uses the Telegram-bot '@TenderParserServiceBot' to enter and save keywords into the database.
The service monitors the presence of tenders with a match in the subject name and, if there are any, sends a message to the user (via a bot).
